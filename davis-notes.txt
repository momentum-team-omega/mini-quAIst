Davis Notes: 📝



Completed: ✅


styled main page ✅
added routing ✅
created login and register components (still need back end) ✅
moved game to it's own component ✅
created temp battle coponent ✅
refactored footer and it's position ✅
gave 'game-container' set height/width to be main game window ✅
switch map being static and character moving freely to character being static and map moving freely. This will keep the character in the center at all times. ✅
created temporary routes for game components 'battle', 'dialogue', and 'create' ✅
Refactored map again this time to accomodate .png maps generated with Tiled ✅
Added collisions overlay on top of map ✅
fix character icon from sliding in place ✅
hold shift to speed up character ✅
remove diagonal ability (interfere's with character direcion) ✅
  -if you're holding x direction down and then you hit y direction, it won't realign to looking x direction after you let go of y direction button 
collision detection version 1.0 !! ✅
  -added collision overlay, still a little touchy especially when running 
took map etc out of game and made 'overworld' component. Game should just be responsible for game flow logic ✅
took char_animate out of char_move and separated those responsibilites ✅
added basic npcs onto the map (chest, old man) ✅
added interactionsData.js and incorporated it into collision logic ✅
add <NPC /> component to overlay npcs onto the map. ✅
Wiki ? ✅
conditional rendering on 'login' (nav & footer) and 'home' (footer) buttons when pathname === '/login' or '/home' not working currently ✅
<NPC /> component not mapping correctly. ✅





To-Do Now: 🚨


Need to be able to remove 'dead' npcs after battle for example. Or change a chest NPC from 'closed' to 'open' etc. 

collision detection version 2.0 
  -add player-zone ✅ figure out running bug
  
figure out how to trigger an inteaction 

buttons for main menu and inventory in top right of game screen

offset character by half tileSize to get it centered

add 2 small maps and test character switching between maps 
  -spawn points & character direction will have to corrospond to 'entrance' point


switch NPC map to using 'NPC' data from Tiled--similar to how the collisions etc is. 


update the map with the gate data 






To-Do Later: 🤷‍♂️


intro cutscene with stable diffusion images
background music ?
  -mute icon in nav
set up back end


walking animation sometimes freezes on a walking frame, should implement a 'default' state for when not walking

add tool tips for early game 'to move, do this' 






Considerations 🧠


maybe add stamina meter for sprint etc ?

add 'Luck' skill to players that determines the roll needed on item rareness when opening a chest 


ability check should render on top of other components, after dice roll should automatically return user to game. 

have character stats show up during ability check 

sleeping at inn saves the game?

'FAQ' man in the villaige could bring up the wiki or somehow route to the





wiki 

what is abililty check?

How does battle work?
