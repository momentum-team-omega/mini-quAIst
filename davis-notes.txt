Davis Notes:


Completed: 

styled main page ✅
added routing ✅
created login and register components (still need back end) ✅
moved game to it's own component ✅
created temp battle coponent ✅
refactored footer and it's position ✅
gave 'game-container' set height/width to be main game window ✅
switch map being static and character moving freely to character being static and map moving freely. This will keep the character in the center at all times. ✅
created temporary routes for game components 'battle', 'dialogue', and 'create' ✅
Refactored map again this time to accomodate .png maps generated with Tiled ✅
Added collisions overlay on top of map ✅
fix character icon from sliding in place ✅
hold shift to speed up character ✅
remove diagonal ability (interfere's with character direcion) ✅
  -if you're holding x direction down and then you hit y direction, it won't realign to looking x direction after you let go of y direction button 




To-Do Now: 🚨

collision detection !!IMPORTANT 
  -added collision overlay, just need to get logic working 




To-Do Later: 🤷‍♂️

intro cutscene with stable diffusion images
background music ?
  -mute icon in nav
set up back end
Wiki ?




Considerations 🧠

slight delay when moving before moving animation begins
walking animation sometimes freezes on a walking frame, should implement a 'default' state for when not walking

disable diagonal movement 
  -disable 'if last pressed' maybe or something 

maybe add stamina meter for sprint etc ?
